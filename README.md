# Code_Jam_Webscraper
## A scraper for getting all the correct solutions in python to all the [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/) contest problems of the years 2008-2017.
The scraper is using [this Site](https://www.go-hero.net/jam/17) for collecting the files. The collected python solutions are saved in the solutions_python folder. There are in total 215 folders, each of them contains all the solutions to one problem, which can for example be used for code similarity checks.
It's possible to scrape problems for different languages with few changes to the config file, altough this is not tested yet.
